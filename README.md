🧠 Anxiety Detection Using Speech Analysis
This project uses machine learning and speech features to detect the severity of anxiety in individuals based on their voice patterns.

📌 About the Project
The purpose of this project is early detection of social anxiety. The system analyzes voice recordings and gives a score indicating the severity of anxiety. If the score is high, the system recommends consulting a professional.

🛠️ Features
Upload audio input and extract voice characteristics
Analyze pauses, breath count, pitch, and tone
Predict anxiety severity using ML model
Output a score and recommendation
